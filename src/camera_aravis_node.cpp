// This is a ROS node that operates GenICam-based cameras (e.g. USB3Vision compatible) via the Aravis library.
// Commonly available camera features are supported through the dynamic_reconfigure user-interface and GUI,
// and for those features not in the GUI but that are specific to a camera, they can be set in the
// camera by setting the appropriate parameter at startup.  This code reads those parameters, and
// if any of them match a camera feature, then the camera is written to.
//
// For example, if a camera has a feature called "IRFormat" that is an integer 0, 1, or 2, you can do
// rosparam set camnode/IRFormat 2
// and this driver will write it to the camera at startup.  Note that the datatype of the parameter
// must be correct for the camera feature (e.g. bool, int, double, string, etc), so for example you should use
// rosparam set camnode/GainAuto true
// and NOT
// rosparam set camnode/GainAuto 1
//
